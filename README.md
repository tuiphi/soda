# 🥤 Soda

Framework for building TUI apps based on the [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

It automatically handles state management and general layout, so that you can focus on app functionality rather than fighting with TTY 🤕🥊🖥️

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/tuiphi/soda
```

## Examples

Take a look at the [examples folder](./_examples)

## Why?

I write TUI apps a lot. And after some trial and error I came up with the structure that suits me the best. I've been copy-pasting it for my projects again and again, so I decided to create a separate package for it so that others can benefit from it too.
